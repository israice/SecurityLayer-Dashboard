## The Threat Is Physical

While organizations invest heavily in software security, physical ports remain the most overlooked attack vector:

- **+37%** year-over-year growth in USB-based attacks
- **$15.4M** average cost per insider threat incident
- **68%** of organizations experienced USB-related security incidents

Traditional solutions either block all USB devices (destroying productivity) or require constant manual monitoring (expensive and unreliable).
